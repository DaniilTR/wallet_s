  - [x] symbol function
  - [x] name function

### Services
- [x] lib/config/bsc_config.dart - Network and token constants
- [x] lib/services/web3_service.dart - Web3Client singleton
  - [x] getBalance helper
  - [x] getGasPrice helper
  - [x] estimateGas helper
- [x] lib/services/crypto_wallet_service.dart - Key management
  - [x] createWallet function
  - [x] importWallet function
  - [x] loadWallet function
  - [x] deleteWallet function
  - [x] Private key stored via flutter_secure_storage
- [x] lib/services/token_service.dart - ERC-20 operations
  - [x] Load ERC-20 ABI
  - [x] Read decimals/symbol/name
  - [x] Get balanceOf
  - [x] Perform transfer with gas estimation
  - [x] ChainId 97 on transactions

### UI Integration
- [x] BSC wallet card added to home screen
- [x] Navigation from home to BSC wallet
- [x] Automatic wallet detection (setup vs home)
- [x] No breaking changes to existing flows

### Safety/Validation
- [x] Validate hex addresses (0x-prefixed, 40 hex chars)
- [x] Validate private key format (64 hex chars)
- [x] Catch and surface RPC/transaction errors
- [x] Check for insufficient tBNB for gas
- [x] Never log or display private keys
- [x] Balance validation before sending
- [x] Amount validation (> 0, <= balance)

### Non-Goals (Correctly Excluded)
