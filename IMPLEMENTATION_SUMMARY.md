## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Network Configuration
- Chain: BNB Smart Chain Testnet
- Chain ID: 97
- RPC: https://bsc-testnet.publicnode.com
- Token: 0xf9Db015ae3D2B413FcA691022c610422FFab4368
- Explorer: https://testnet.bscscan.com

### ✅ Wallet Management
- Create new wallet (random private key generation)
- Import wallet from hex private key (0x-prefixed)
- Secure storage via flutter_secure_storage
- NO mnemonic support (as required)

### ✅ Token Operations
- Load and cache token metadata (name, symbol, decimals)
- Display token balance formatted with decimals
- Display native tBNB balance for gas
- Transfer tokens via transfer(to, amount)
- Gas estimation with 20% buffer
- Transaction signing with chainId 97

### ✅ UI/UX
- Setup screen: Create or Import wallet by private key
- Home screen: Address, tBNB balance, Token balance
- Send screen: Recipient input, amount input, gas validation
- Receive screen: Address display, QR code generation
- Navigation integrated into main app
- Error handling and validation
- BscScan deep links for transactions

### ✅ Security
- Private keys stored in flutter_secure_storage
- Address validation (0x + 40 hex chars)
- Private key validation (64 hex chars)
- Balance checks before sending
- Gas availability checks
- No private key logging or display

### ✅ Dependencies Added
- web3dart: ^2.7.3 - Blockchain interaction
- flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0 - Secure key storage
- qr_flutter: ^4.1.0 - QR code generation
- All dependencies verified with gh-advisory-database (no vulnerabilities)

## Code Quality
- Follows Flutter best practices
- Consistent with existing codebase style
- Proper error handling throughout
- Clear separation of concerns (config, services, UI)
- Documented code with comments
- Type-safe implementations

## Testing Requirements
To test this implementation:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install new dependencies
2. Ensure you have Flutter 3.0+ installed
3. Run `flutter run` on a device/emulator
4. Access BSC wallet from main home screen
5. Test create/import functionality
6. Get testnet tBNB from a faucet
7. Test send/receive operations

## What's NOT Included (as per requirements)
- ❌ Mnemonic/BIP-39 support (explicitly excluded)
- ❌ Mainnet support (testnet only)
- ❌ Multiple wallet support
- ❌ Transaction history
- ❌ Biometric authentication

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The user should:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
2. Build and run the app
3. Test wallet creation/import
4. Test token operations on BSC Testnet
5. Verify all functionality works as expected
